2. Computing file hashes to identify models
3. Querying the CivitAI API to retrieve metadata
4. Saving metadata as JSON files
5. Downloading preview images (optional)
6. Generating HTML preview pages (optional)
7. Organizing files based on metadata (optional)

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for API access

### Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moonwhaler/civitscraper.git
cd civitscraper
pip install -e .
```

### Using Virtual Environment (venv)

For isolated dependencies and cleaner package management, you can install CivitScraper in a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv civitscraper-env

# Activate the virtual environment

# On Windows:
civitscraper-env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source civitscraper-env/bin/activate

# Install CivitScraper in the virtual environment
git clone https://github.com/moonwhaler/civitscraper.git
cd civitscraper
pip install -e .

# Now you can use CivitScraper
civitscraper --help

# When finished, deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

This approach keeps CivitScraper's dependencies isolated from your system Python installation.

## Configuration

CivitScraper uses a YAML configuration file to control its behavior. The default configuration file is located at `config/default.yaml`.

### Global Defaults

The `defaults` section defines default settings that apply to all operations unless overridden in specific sections:

```yaml
defaults:
  scan:
    recursive: true      # Search in subdirectories
    skip_existing: true  # Skip files that already have metadata
    verify_hashes: true  # Verify file hashes against CivitAI data

  output:
    metadata:
      format: "json"
      path: "{model_dir}"     # Where to save metadata
      filename: "{model_name}.json"  # Metadata filename
      html:
        enabled: true         # Generate HTML preview pages
        filename: "{model_name}.html"  # HTML filename
    images:
      save: true             # Download preview images
      path: "{model_dir}"    # Where to save images
      max_count: 4           # Maximum number of images to download
      filenames:
        preview: "{model_name}.preview{ext}"  # Preview image filename pattern

  organization:
    enabled: false            # Enable model organization
    dry_run: false          # Simulate file operations without making changes
    template: "by_type_and_basemodel"      # Organization template to use
    custom_template: ""      # Custom organization path template
    output_dir: "{model_dir}/organized"  # Where to put organized files
    operation_mode: "move"   # [copy/move/symlink] How to organize files
```

### API Configuration

The `api` section configures the connection to the CivitAI API:

```yaml
api:
  key: "your_api_key"                # Your CivitAI API key
  base_url: "https://civitai.com/api/v1"  # API endpoint
  timeout: 30             # [seconds] API request timeout
  max_retries: 3         # Number of times to retry failed requests
  user_agent: "CivitScraper/0.2.0"  # User agent string

  # Batch processing settings
  batch:
    enabled: true         # Enable batch processing
    max_concurrent: 4     # Maximum parallel requests
    rate_limit: 100      # Requests/minute
    retry_delay: 1000    # Base delay (ms) for exponential backoff
    cache_size: 100      # LRU cache size

    # Circuit breaker prevents API abuse during outages
    circuit_breaker:
      failure_threshold: 5    # Number of failures before blocking requests
      reset_timeout: 60       # Seconds to wait before auto-recovery
```

### Input Paths

The `input_paths` section defines where to look for different types of model files:

```yaml
input_paths:
  # LORA models directory
  lora:
    path: "/path/to/lora/models"     # Directory containing LORA models
    type: LORA                       # Model type identifier
    patterns: ["*.safetensors"]      # File patterns to match

  # Stable Diffusion checkpoints
  checkpoints:
    path: "/path/to/checkpoints"     # Directory containing checkpoints
    type: Checkpoint                 # Model type identifier
    patterns: ["*.safetensors"]      # File patterns to match

  # Textual Inversion embeddings
  embeddings:
    path: "/path/to/embeddings"      # Directory containing embeddings
    type: TextualInversion           # Model type identifier
    patterns: ["*.pt", "*.safetensors"]  # File patterns to match
```

### Job Templates

The `job_templates` section defines reusable configurations for common tasks:

```yaml
job_templates:
  # Basic scan without organization
  base_scan:
    type: scan-paths
    inherit: defaults.scan          # Inherits scanning settings from defaults
    output:
      metadata:
        format: "json"
        path: "{model_dir}"
        filename: "{model_name}.json"
        html:
          enabled: true
          filename: "{model_name}.html"
      images:
        save: true
        path: "{model_dir}"
        max_count: 4
        filenames:
          preview: "{model_name}.preview{ext}"
    organize: false                 # Don't organize files

  # Full processing with organization
  full_process:
    type: scan-paths
    inherit: job_templates.base_scan  # Builds upon base_scan template
    output:
      metadata:
        format: "json"
        path: "{model_dir}"
        filename: "{model_name}.json"
        html:

      images:
        save: true
        path: "{model_dir}"
        max_count: 4
        filenames:
          preview: "{model_name}.preview{ext}"
    organize: false
    organization: 
      inherit: defaults.organization  # Use default organization settings

  # Metadata-only template
  metadata_only:
    type: scan-paths
    inherit: job_templates.base_scan
    output:
      inherit: defaults.output
      images:
        save: false             # Disable image downloads

  # Trigger word synchronization template
  sync_triggers:
    type: sync-lora-triggers
    description: "Synchronize LoRA trigger words"
    inherit: defaults.scan
    loras_file: "loras.json"
    paths: []
```

### Jobs

The `jobs` section defines specific tasks to run:

```yaml
# Default job to run when no job is specified
default_job: "fetch-all"

jobs:
  # Process all model types
  fetch-all:
    template: full_process         # Use full processing template
    paths: ["lora"]                # Process all path types
```

### Organization Settings

The organization settings control how files are organized based on metadata:

```yaml
organization:
  enabled: false            # Enable model organization
  dry_run: false            # Simulate file operations without making changes
  template: "by_type_and_basemodel"  # Organization template to use
  custom_template: ""       # Custom organization path template
  output_dir: "{model_dir}/organized"  # Where to put organized files

## Core Features

### Scanning and Processing Model Files

CivitScraper scans directories for model files based on the configured input paths. It uses file patterns to identify model files and can search recursively in subdirectories.

The scanner can be configured to:
- Skip files that already have metadata
- Verify file hashes against CivitAI data
- Force refresh metadata

```yaml
defaults:
  scan:
    recursive: true      # Search in subdirectories
    skip_existing: true  # Skip files that already have metadata
    verify_hashes: true  # Verify file hashes against CivitAI data
```

### Metadata Retrieval

CivitScraper retrieves metadata from the CivitAI API based on file hashes. The metadata includes:
- Model name and description
- Creator information
- Tags
- Model type
- Base model
- NSFW status
- Creation date
- Statistics (downloads, favorites, ratings)
- Trained words (for LORA models)
- Preview images

The metadata is saved as JSON files in the configured location:

```yaml
output:
  metadata:
    format: "json"
    path: "{model_dir}"     # Where to save metadata
    filename: "{model_name}.json"  # Metadata filename
```

### Image Downloading

CivitScraper can download preview images for models from the CivitAI API. The images are saved in the configured location:

```yaml
output:
  images:
    save: true             # Download preview images
    path: "{model_dir}"    # Where to save images
    max_count: 4           # Maximum number of images to download
    filenames:
      preview: "{model_name}.preview{ext}"  # Preview image filename pattern
```

### HTML Preview Generation

CivitScraper can generate HTML preview pages for models. The HTML pages include:
- Model name and description
- Creator information
- Tags
- Model type
- Base model
- NSFW status
- Creation date
- Statistics (downloads, favorites, ratings)
- Trained words (for LORA models)
- Preview images
- Generation parameters (if available)

The HTML pages are saved in the configured location:

```yaml
output:
  metadata:
    html:
      enabled: true         # Generate HTML preview pages
      filename: "{model_name}.html"  # HTML filename
```

### File Organization

CivitScraper can organize model files based on metadata. The organization is controlled by the organization settings:

```yaml
organization:
  enabled: false            # Enable model organization
  dry_run: false            # Simulate file operations without making changes
  template: "by_type_and_basemodel"  # Organization template to use
  custom_template: ""       # Custom organization path template
  output_dir: "{model_dir}/organized"  # Where to put organized files
  operation_mode: "move"    # [copy/move/symlink] How to organize files
```

The organization can be performed using different operation modes:
- `copy`: Copy files to the organized location
- `move`: Move files to the organized location
- `symlink`: Create symbolic links in the organized location

## Job System

### Understanding Jobs

Jobs are specific tasks that CivitScraper can execute. Each job has a type and can inherit settings from job templates or default settings.

The main job types are:
- `scan-paths`: Scan directories for model files and process them
- `sync-lora-triggers`: Synchronize LORA trigger words with a Krita AI Diffusion (loras.json) file

### Job Templates

Job templates are reusable configurations for common tasks. They can inherit settings from other templates or default settings.

```yaml
job_templates:
  base_scan:
    type: scan-paths
    inherit: defaults.scan
    # ...

  full_process:
    type: scan-paths
    inherit: job_templates.base_scan
    # ...
```

### Creating Custom Jobs

You can create custom jobs by defining them in the `jobs` section of the configuration file:

```yaml
jobs:
  my_custom_job:
    template: full_process         # Use a template
    paths: ["lora", "checkpoints"]  # Process specific paths
    # Override template settings
    output:
      images:
        max_count: 2               # Override max_count
```

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing

CivitScraper supports batch processing for efficient handling of large collections. The batch processing settings control concurrency and rate limiting:

```yaml
api:
  batch:
    enabled: true         # Enable batch processing
    max_concurrent: 4     # Maximum parallel requests
    rate_limit: 100       # Requests/minute
    retry_delay: 1000     # Base delay (ms) for exponential backoff
    cache_size: 100       # LRU cache size
```

### Custom Organization Templates

You can create custom organization templates using the `custom_template` setting:

```yaml
organization:
  custom_template: "{type}/{creator}/{base_model}"
```

Available placeholders:
- `{model_name}`: Model name
- `{model_type}`: Model type
- `{type}`: Model type (alias for model_type)
- `{creator}`: Creator username
- `{base_model}`: Base model
- `{nsfw}`: NSFW status (nsfw/sfw)
- `{year}`: Creation year
- `{month}`: Creation month

### API Rate Limiting and Circuit Breaker

CivitScraper includes rate limiting and circuit breaker protection to prevent API abuse:

```yaml
api:
  batch:
    rate_limit: 100       # Requests/minute
    circuit_breaker:
      failure_threshold: 5    # Number of failures before blocking requests
      reset_timeout: 60       # Seconds to wait before auto-recovery
```

### Caching

CivitScraper caches API responses to reduce API usage and improve performance:

```yaml
scanner:
  cache_dir: ".civitscraper_cache"  # Where to store cache files
  cache_validity: 86400            # [seconds] Cache lifetime (24 hours)
  force_refresh: false             # Ignore cache and force refresh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Issues

If you encounter API key issues, make sure your API key is correctly set in the configuration file or as an environment variable:

```yaml
api:
  key: "your_api_key"
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export CIVITAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

#### Rate Limiting

If you encounter rate limiting issues, try reducing the `rate_limit` setting:

```yaml
api:
  batch:
    rate_limit: 50        # Reduce from 100 to 50
```

#### File Organization Issues

If file organization is not working as expected, check the organization settings:

```yaml
organization:
  enabled: true           # Make sure this is true
  template: "by_type_and_basemodel"
  output_dir: "{model_dir}/organized"
  operation_mode: "copy"  # Try "copy" instead of "move" for testing
```

### Logging

CivitScraper provides detailed logging to help diagnose issues:

```yaml
logging:
  level: DEBUG            # Set to DEBUG for more detailed logs
  console:
    enabled: true
    level: DEBUG          # Set to DEBUG for more detailed console logs
  file:
    enabled: true
    level: DEBUG
    directory: logs
```

You can also enable debug logging from the command line:

```bash
civitscraper --debug
```

Log files are stored in the configured log directory (default: `logs`).
